How we'll be using classes
class DataStructure(){
  constructo(){
    // what default properties should it have?
  }
  someInstanceMethod(){
    // what should each object created from this class be able to do?
  }
}

We will be using the constructor and instance methods quite a bit!
We will almost never be using static methods

One gotcha with 'this'
  Inside all of our instance methods and constructor, the keyword 'this' refers to the object created from that class (also know as an instance)

Recap
 - Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances
 - Classes are created with the new keyword
 - The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
 - Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
 - Class methods can be added using the static keyword
